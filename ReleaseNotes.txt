libdas2 - A re-work of Das2StreamUtils + das1 support.

This library and it's associated utility programs are intended for reading,
processing and writing Das2 Streams.  It provides no support for data display
as that is handled by the extensive Java dasCore library and Autoplot.
libdas2 and it's utilities are a re-work of Jeremy's Das2StreamUtilities.


Changes from libdas2 1.0 verses Das2StreamUtils
-----------------------------------------------

1. Much more attention is paid to memory usage.  This work-alike library
   should not leak memory.
   
2. Full Doxygen documentation has been added for all library functions.
   Documentation was written in Javadoc style for compatibility with the
   Netbeans IDE.

3. Utility programs have full manpage text.

4. Utility programs always return non-zero value to the shell on an 
   error to better interoperate with the Das2 server.
   
5. Assumptions in the utility programs that packets contain only one <y>
   or <yscan> plane per packet have been removed.
   
6. timeXX and asciiXX data value encodings are now variable width instead
   of a fixed enumeration of sizes.

7. Error handling improved.  Library no longer calls abort() unless the
   end user wants it to, option to return on error instead of calling
   exit() added, error messages improved to provide specific file and
   line numbers for debugging.

8. <z> planes now allowed in packets, library checks for presence
   of corresponding <y> plane.
   
9. Encoding class introduced which allows for overridding I/O ASCII 
   encodings.  Yscan items can also have a custom ASCII encoding.

10. Buffer class introduced to cut down on internal memory copies.
   
11. Callback processing improved.  User data pointers added to allow for
   stateful processing.  Both input and output operations can have
   processing hooks, 1-n callback sets allowed for input or output to
   allow for more modular processing.

12. Das2 Stream property handling updated.  Uses Standard property names
   from the Das 2.2 ICD, but is backwards compatable.  All standard
   property types are handled (boolean, int, double, String, Datum, and
   DatumRange)

13. C99 compliance.  GCC specific extensions have been replaced.

14. New library uses more standard C syntax.  'const' is used to indicate
    items which will not be mutated, array counters are of type size_t 
    and pointers are visible as pointers and not hidden via typedefs.  All
    globals and static variables have been removed to allow for lib use in
    multi-threaded applications.


Using das2 C-lib versus das2StreamUtil
--------------------------------------
Linking:
    Replace -lDas2Stream with -ldas2

Compiling:
    Replace "#include <Das2Stream.h>" with "#include <das2/core.h>"

Scripting:
    Program names have been changed so that they my exist in the filesystem
    next to existing versions.  Corresponding names are given below:
    
    Das2StreamUtils        LibDas2
    ---------------        ---------
    binAverage             das2_bin_avg
    binAverageSeconds      das2_bin_avgsec
    das1ToDas2             das2_from_das1
    deflateStream          das2_deflate
    inflateStream          das2_inflate
    peakAverageSeconds     das2_bin_peakavgsec
    toAscii                das2_ascii
    toBinary               das2_binary
