Instructions for building das2C on Windows 10 using visual studio tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows software devolpoment is cumbersome.  There is more than one generally
accepted compiler, essential tools typically are not on your PATH and the
default package manager cannot be used to grab small library dependencies. 
Many different trails can be hacked through through this mess.  The proceedure
given here is not neccesarily the best, just the path that the authors of das2C
selected.

Step -2: Install Visual Studio Tools
====================================
First we need a compiler.  Since most system DLLs were compiled with Visual C++,
this is the compiler we'll use.  To insure compatability with pre-compiled
Python3 modules we'll use:

  Microsoft Visual C++ 14.2 standalone.
  
Go here:

  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Open the "Tools for Visual Studio 2019" accordian and find:

 "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019"

Click "Download" to get the installer.  It should be a small file named:

  vs_BuildTools.exe
  
Run this file as Administrator.

From the installer screen select "C++ build tools" then on the sidebar select
at least the following opitons:

  * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
  * Windows 10 SDK

select other options as you see fit.  The CMake tools can be handy.

In the "Install locations" tab, feel free to enter a much shorter paths for the
install loacation.  The author shortened:

  C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools
  C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Packages
  C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared
  
to:

  C:\opt\vs\2019\buildtools
  C:\opt\vs\packages
  C:\opt\vs\shared

The rest of these notes will assume the locations above.  Substitute as needed
for your system.  

After install you will need to reboot your computer, hopefully it's not a
server.

Step -1: Test Command Line Environment
======================================
After install, open a dos shell and run the Visual C environment config script:

  "\opt\vs\2019\buildtools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
  
or equivalent.  You should get the output:

  **********************************************************************
  ** Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt v16.4.4
  ** Copyright (c) 2019 Microsoft Corporation
  **********************************************************************
  [vcvarsall.bat] Environment initialized for: 'x64'

Then try:

  cl.exe
  
If this works, then you now have a compiler on your path!
