# libdas2
das2 stream reading/writing library for C, Python and D-lang programs


libdas2 is a re-worked version of Das2StreamUtils with the addition of
das1 support and more wrappers to support server-side stream processesing.
It intended for reading, processing and writing Das2 Streams.  It provides
no support for data display as that is handled by the extensive Java dasCore
library and Autoplot.
